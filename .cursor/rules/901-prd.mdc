# Product Requirements Document Format

When working with any file that has 'PRD' or 'requirements' in the filename, format the document according to the following guidelines:

## Title and Overview

- Include a brief product overview (1-2 paragraphs)
- Add a change log or version history

## Problem Statement & Goals
- Clearly define the problem being solved
- List specific, measurable goals
- Include user personas if relevant

## Requirements
- Organize requirements into functional and non-functional categories
- Use simple, declarative language
- Number or label requirements for easy reference
- Mark requirements as "Must Have," "Should Have," "Could Have," or "Won't Have" (MoSCoW method)

## Constraints
- List technical, business, and timeline constraints
- Document assumptions and dependencies

## Success Metrics
- Define how success will be measured
- List specific KPIs and targets

## Appendices
- Include references to related documents
- Add technical details as needed
