## Initial Project Prompt

```
I have an idea for a new project called Mumbl.
Project Description:
Mumbl is a simple application that allows users to transcribe their speech into text using their microphone. The main purpose is to provide an easy and quick way to convert spoken words into written text without any complex features or setup.
Target Users:
This application is designed for anyone who needs to convert speech to text easily, such as students taking notes, professionals transcribing meetings or interviews, and writers who prefer dictating their thoughts.
Key Features:  
Real-time transcription of speech to text.  

Ability to save transcribed text to a file.  

Simple user interface for starting and stopping transcription.

Technical Requirements:  
Built using Python with the SpeechRecognition and PyAudio libraries.  

Requires an internet connection for accessing Google's Speech Recognition service.



Please help me:
1. Create an initial project structure
2. Set up the core dependencies
3. Implement a basic skeleton of the application
4. Suggest a development roadmap for implementing the key features
```
